  <h1>Niklas Dewally</h1>
  <div class=tagline>
    I am a second year Computer Science student at University of St Andrews.
    Currently I am undertaking a research internship studying graph transfer
    learning. (Supervised by Juan Ye and Simon Dobson).

  <p>
  I put code on <a href=https://github.com/niklasdewally>Github</a> from time to time, including a
  <a href="https://github.com/Kieranoski702/Hackathon-Web-Browser">rather hacky text-based web
  browser</a> written during a hackathon to learn Rust. In the future, we probably will use
<i>pandoc</i> to parse HTML for us instead, as parser writing is hard :).
