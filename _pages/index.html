    I am an undergraduate research intern and third year Computer Science
    student at University of St Andrews.

  <h2>Research</h2>
    I am currently a research intern studying the transfer learning of Graph
    Neural Networks (under the supervision of Juan Ye and Peter Mann).
    <p>
    Our aim is to better understand how Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can be
    used to capture the general structure of networks, and how this can be used
    to train a GNN for use on unseen networks. In particular, we are looking at
    training a GNN on a small network, and using this to make predictions about
    a structurally similar, large network. This could be used, for example, to
    predict the spread of a large epidemic based on early infections.
    <p>
    My responsibilities in this project have included: the design and
    implementation of computational experiments; the preparation of datasets;
    the implementation and tuning of deep learning models using <a
    href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a>; and data analysis.

  <p>
  I put code on <a href=https://github.com/niklasdewally>Github</a> from time to time, including a
  <a href="https://github.com/Kieranoski702/Hackathon-Web-Browser">rather hacky text-based web
  browser</a> written during a hackathon to learn Rust. In the future, we probably will use
<i>pandoc</i> to parse HTML for us instead, as parser writing is hard :).
